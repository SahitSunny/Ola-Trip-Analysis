# Ola Ride Analysis

## Description

This project analyzes the Ola ride trips in a day, extracted useful information using SQL queries, and visualized it using PowerBI. The project aims to provide insights into the patterns and trends of Ola ride usage, such as the most popular destinations, peak hours and average fares

## Installation

To run this project, you will need the following tools:

- SQL Server: A relational database management system that stores and retrieves data using SQL queries.
- PowerBI Desktop: A data visualization and reporting tool that connects to various data sources and creates interactive dashboards and reports.
- Ola Ride Dataset: A sample dataset of Ola ride trips in a day, containing information such as booking ID, pickup and drop locations, distance and fare.

To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Download and install SQL Server and PowerBI Desktop on your machine.
2. Import the sql file into SQL Server.
3. Write SQL queries to extract the information you want to analyze. You can use the SQL Server Management Studio or any other SQL editor of your choice.
4. Connect PowerBI Desktop to the SQL Server database and import the query results as data sources.
5. Create visualizations and reports using PowerBI Desktop, such as charts, maps, tables, and slicers. You can use the PowerBI Desktop documentation or any other online tutorials to learn how to use PowerBI Desktop.

## Usage

To use this project, you can open the PowerBI Desktop file that contains the visualizations and reports you created. You can interact with the visualizations by filtering, sorting, or drilling down the data. You can also export the visualizations as images or PDF files, or publish them to the PowerBI service to share them online.
